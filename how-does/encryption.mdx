## Asymmetric Encryption (Single Recipient)

When publishing to a single partner, EnSync uses **asymmetric encryption**:

- Your message is encrypted with the recipient's public key
- Only the recipient can decrypt it with their private key
- Fast and efficient for one-to-one communication

## Hybrid Encryption (Multiple Recipients)

When publishing to multiple partners, EnSync uses **hybrid encryption**:

- Message is encrypted once with a symmetric key (AES)
- The symmetric key is encrypted separately for each recipient using their public key
- Each recipient decrypts their copy of the symmetric key, then decrypts the message
- Efficient for one-to-many: message encrypted once, not per recipient

## Key Management

- Partners receive `appSecret` (decryption key) during onboarding
- Service providers receive partner's `appId` (public identifier)
- EnSync handles key generation and distribution automatically
