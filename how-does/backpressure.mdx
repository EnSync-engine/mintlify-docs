## Need-Based Push Model

EnSync delivers events **one at a time**. The server only pushes the next event after you've processed the current one by calling `ack()`, `defer()`, or `discard()`.

## Example

If 50 events are published in 2 seconds:
- You receive event 1
- Process it and call `ack()`
- Only then do you receive event 2
- This continues at your processing speed

## Scaling Throughput

To receive events faster, create multiple workers with separate client instances. Each worker receives events independently:

- 1 worker = 1 event at a time
- 5 workers = 5 events at a time
- Scale workers based on your processing capacity

## Benefits

- **Automatic flow control**: No manual rate limiting needed
- **Horizontal scaling**: Add workers to increase throughput
- **No buffering issues**: Events aren't queued in your application memory
