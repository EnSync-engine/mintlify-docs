## Queue per Event Type

Each partner (`appId`) has a **separate queue for each event type** (`eventId`). Events within `order/created` are ordered, but `order/created` and `order/updated` have independent queues.

## Parallel Processing

Multiple workers can process events from the same queue simultaneously:

- Worker 1 pulls event 1 → starts processing
- Worker 2 pulls event 2 → starts processing
- Worker 3 pulls event 3 → starts processing

Events are **pulled in order** but **processed concurrently**.

## Automatic Failover

If a worker fails to complete processing within ~1 minute, the event returns to the queue for any worker to pick up.

## Ordering Guarantees

| Scenario | Ordered? |
|----------|----------|
| Same event type (e.g., `order/created`) | ✅ Yes |
| Different event types (e.g., `order/created` vs `order/updated`) | ❌ No |
| Multiple workers on same event type | ✅ Yes (pulled in order) |

<Note>
No head-of-line blocking: slow events don't block the queue since multiple workers process concurrently.
