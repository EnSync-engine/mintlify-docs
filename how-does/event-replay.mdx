## Event Retention

EnSync stores events for **90 days**, allowing you to replay them for debugging, reconciliation, or recovering from missed events.

## Replay Metadata

Replayed events include `replay_info` in metadata:

```javascript
{
  eventName: "order/created",
  idem: "event-idem-123",
  payload: { /* your data */ },
  metadata: {
    $internal: {
      replay_info: {
        isReplayed: true,
        replayTimestamp: 1758410511179,
        wasAcknowledged: false
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Replay Info Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `isReplayed` | `boolean` | `true` if this is a replayed event |
| `replayTimestamp` | `number` | When the replay was triggered |
| `wasAcknowledged` | `boolean` | Whether event was previously acknowledged |

## Use Cases

- **Debugging**: Replay events to reproduce issues
- **Data reconciliation**: Reprocess events after fixing bugs
- **Missed events**: Recover events if your system was down
- **Testing**: Replay production events in staging

<Note>
Check `isReplayed` flag to handle replayed events differently (e.g., skip duplicate processing).
