## EnSync vs. Cloud Message Queues (SQS / Google Pub/Sub)

| **Criteria** | **SQS / Google Pub/Sub** | **EnSync** |
|-------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Primary Use Case** | Internal async messaging between microservices | B2B partner ecosystem integration |
| **Target Audience** | Your internal engineering team | External partners + your team |
| **Partner Onboarding** | N/A (not designed for external partners) | Self-service in 15 minutes |
| **Access Control** | IAM policies (cloud account level) | Workspace isolation per partner |
| **Message Retention** | 14 days max (SQS), 7 days default (Pub/Sub) | 90 days (configurable) |
| **Replay Capability** | No native replay | Built-in 90-day replay |
| **Message Ordering** | FIFO queues (limited throughput) | Ordered delivery per event type |
| **Schema Management** | No schema enforcement | Structured events with versioning |
| **Partner Visibility** | CloudWatch/Stackdriver (your account only) | Per-partner observability dashboard |
| **Bidirectional Communication** | Requires separate queues | Native bidirectional events |
| **Multi-Tenancy** | Requires separate AWS/GCP accounts | Targeted delivery + workspace isolation |
| **Event Naming** | Queue names (flat structure) | Path-like hierarchy (`payment/authorized`) |
| **Best For** | Internal microservices communication | External partner integrations |
| **Partner Self-Service** | N/A | Embedded onboarding page |
| **Compliance/Audit** | CloudTrail/Cloud Logging (your view only) | Full audit trails per partner |

## Bottom Line

**SQS/Pub/Sub broadcasts to all subscribers. EnSync delivers to specific partners.**

SQS/Pub/Sub connects your microservices. EnSync connects your business partners.

## When to Choose SQS/Pub/Sub

- You need internal microservices messaging within your own infrastructure
- You're building event-driven architecture for your own services
- All consumers are within your AWS/GCP account

## When to Choose EnSync

- You're integrating with external business partners
- You need targeted event delivery (not broadcast to all)
- You need high throughput for partner integration workloads
- You need partner-specific isolation and visibility
- You want partners to self-onboard and manage their integration
- You need long-term message retention and replay
- You need two-layer access control (permissions + subscriptions)

<Note>
While EnSync can be used for internal messaging, our focus is on B2B partner integration where workspace isolation, partner observability, and self-service onboarding provide the most value.
