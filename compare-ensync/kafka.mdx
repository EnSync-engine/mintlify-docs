## EnSync vs. Event Streaming Platforms (Apache Kafka)

| **Criteria** | **Apache Kafka** | **EnSync** |
|-------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Primary Use Case** | High-throughput event streaming, data pipelines | B2B partner ecosystem integration |
| **Integration Model** | Topic-based streaming | Partner-centric workspaces |
| **Partner Onboarding** | Manual topic/consumer setup, complex configuration | Self-service in 15 minutes |
| **Scalability** | Horizontal partitioning (optimized for extreme throughput) | Horizontal scaling (optimized for partner integration) |
| **Message Delivery** | At-least-once (configurable to exactly-once) | Guaranteed delivery + 90-day replay |
| **Message Ordering** | Partition-level ordering only | Ordered delivery per event type |
| **Access Control** | ACLs per topic (complex to manage) | Workspace-based + granular permissions |
| **Partner Visibility** | Limited (requires custom tooling) | Full observability dashboard per partner |
| **Message Retention** | Configurable (days to weeks, storage-dependent) | 90 days (configurable) |
| **Replay Capability** | Consumer offset management (complex) | Built-in 90-day replay (simple) |
| **Schema Management** | Schema Registry (separate component) | Structured events with versioning (built-in) |
| **Bidirectional Communication** | Requires separate topics | Native bidirectional events |
| **Partner Self-Service** | No | Embedded onboarding page |
| **Developer Experience** | Steep learning curve, ops-heavy | Lightweight SDK, consistent API |
| **Operational Complexity** | High (ZooKeeper, brokers, monitoring) | Low (managed service) |
| **Time to First Integration** | Days to weeks | Minutes |
| **Maintenance Burden** | High (cluster management, rebalancing) | Low (centralized, managed) |
| **Cost Model** | Infrastructure + operational overhead | Platform fee (scales with usage) |
| **Best For** | High-volume event streaming, analytics, data pipelines | B2B partner integrations at scale |

## Bottom Line

**Kafka streams data internally. EnSync connects external partners.**

They can work together—partners integrate with your Kafka-powered platform via EnSync.

## When to Choose Kafka

- You need extreme-scale event streaming for analytics
- You're building data pipelines or event sourcing
- You need internal event streaming at massive scale
- You have dedicated ops team for cluster management

## When to Choose EnSync

- You're integrating with external business partners
- You need high throughput optimized for partner integration
- You want partners to self-onboard without complex setup
- You need partner-specific isolation and observability
- You want managed service with low operational overhead

## Using Both Together

EnSync and Kafka complement each other:
- Use Kafka internally for high-throughput event streaming
- Use EnSync to expose your platform to external partners
- Partners integrate with your Kafka-powered platform via EnSync's simple SDK

## Sales Positioning

*"Kafka streams data. EnSync connects ecosystems. We're not replacing Kafka—we're enabling partners to integrate with your Kafka-powered platform."*
