## EnSync vs. Integration Platform as a Service (IPaaS)

| **Criteria** | **IPaaS (Zapier, MuleSoft, Workato, Tray.io)** | **EnSync** |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|------------|
| **Primary Use Case** | Pre-built connectors for SaaS app integration | Custom B2B partner ecosystem integration |
| **Integration Model** | No-code/low-code workflows | Developer-first SDK + API |
| **Partner Onboarding** | Partners use pre-built connectors | Self-service embedded page (15 min) |
| **Customization** | Limited to available connectors | Fully customizable event schemas |
| **Real-Time Capability** | Polling-based (minutes delay) or webhooks | True real-time (milliseconds) |
| **Message Delivery** | Best-effort (retries vary by platform) | Guaranteed delivery + 90-day replay |
| **Message Ordering** | Not guaranteed | Ordered delivery per event type |
| **Access Control** | App-level permissions | Workspace-based + granular permissions |
| **Partner Visibility** | Workflow logs (limited) | Full observability dashboard per partner |
| **Message Retention** | 7-30 days (varies by platform) | 90 days (configurable) |
| **Replay Capability** | Manual re-run of workflows | Built-in 90-day replay |
| **Schema Management** | Connector-defined schemas (inflexible) | Structured events with versioning |
| **Bidirectional Communication** | Requires separate workflows | Native bidirectional events |
| **Event Naming** | Connector-specific naming | Path-like hierarchy (`payment/authorized`) |
| **Developer Experience** | No-code UI (limited for complex logic) | Lightweight SDK, full programmatic control |
| **Scalability** | Task-based pricing (expensive at scale) | Horizontal scaling (predictable pricing) |
| **Data Ownership** | Data passes through IPaaS servers | Direct partner-to-platform communication |
| **Offline Resilience** | Workflow failures require manual intervention | Automatic retry + queue when partner offline |
| **Cost Model** | Per-task or per-workflow pricing | Platform fee (scales with usage) |
| **Time to First Integration** | Hours (if connector exists), weeks (if custom) | Minutes |
| **Best For** | Non-technical users, standard SaaS integrations | Developers building custom partner ecosystems |
| **Vendor Lock-In** | High (proprietary workflows) | Low (standard SDK, open protocols) |
| **Compliance/Audit** | Workflow logs (limited retention) | Full audit trails + searchable logs |
| **Partner Self-Service** | Partners need IPaaS account | Embedded onboarding (no third-party account) |

## Bottom Line

**IPaaS is for connecting off-the-shelf SaaS apps. EnSync is for building your own partner ecosystem with custom integrations at scale.**

## When to Choose IPaaS

- You need to connect standard SaaS apps (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)
- Non-technical users need to build integrations
- You have simple, pre-defined workflows
- You're okay with polling delays and best-effort delivery

## When to Choose EnSync

- You're building a custom B2B platform or partner ecosystem
- You need real-time, reliable messaging
- You want full control over event schemas and logic
- You need developer-first SDK and API
- You want predictable pricing at scale

## Sales Positioning

*"IPaaS connects off-the-shelf apps. EnSync builds custom partner ecosystems."*
