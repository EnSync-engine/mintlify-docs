## EnSync vs. Traditional Partner Integration

| **Criteria** | **Traditional Partner Integration** | **EnSync** |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|------------|
| **Integration Model** | Custom API per partner | One implementation, infinite partners |
| **Partner Onboarding Time** | 3-6 weeks per partner (custom development) | 15 minutes (self-service embedded page) |
| **Scalability** | Linear cost: 1 engineer per 5-10 partners | Same team handles 100+ partners |
| **Message Delivery** | Webhooks (unreliable) or polling (expensive) | Guaranteed delivery + automatic retries |
| **Real-Time Capability** | Polling (minutes delay) or unreliable webhooks | True real-time (milliseconds) |
| **Message Ordering** | Not guaranteed | Ordered delivery per event type |
| **Access Control** | Custom implementation per integration | Workspace-based + granular permissions |
| **Partner Visibility** | None (black box for partners) | Full observability dashboard per partner |
| **Message Retention** | Not applicable | 90 days (configurable) with replay |
| **Replay Capability** | Manual re-processing required | Built-in 90-day replay for compliance |
| **Schema Management** | Per-partner negotiation and documentation | Structured events with versioning |
| **Bidirectional Communication** | Requires separate integrations | Native bidirectional events |
| **Partner Self-Service** | None - requires your engineering team | Embedded onboarding page |
| **Offline Resilience** | Messages lost during downtime | Automatic retry + queue when partner offline |
| **Maintenance Burden** | High (update each partner separately) | Low (centralized updates) |
| **Time to First Integration** | 3-6 weeks | Minutes |
| **Cost Model** | Per-partner development + maintenance | Platform fee (scales with usage) |
| **Compliance/Audit** | Manual logging per integration | Full audit trails + searchable logs |
| **Partner Ecosystem** | Siloed integrations | Connected ecosystem with network effects |

## Bottom Line

**Traditional integration doesn't scale. EnSync does.**

## When to Choose Traditional Integration

- You have 1-3 stable partners and no plans to scale
- Partners have unique, non-standard requirements
- Integration is a one-time project, not ongoing

## When to Choose EnSync

- You're building a B2B platform with partner integrations
- You plan to scale partner integrations (even starting with 1 partner)
- You need high throughput for real-time partner messaging
- You want partners to self-onboard
- You need reliable messaging with guaranteed delivery
- You want to reduce engineering overhead
- You're thinking integration-first from day one

## Sales Positioning

*"Stop building custom integrations for every partner. Build once, scale infinitely."*
