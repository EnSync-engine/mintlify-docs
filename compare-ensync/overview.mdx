# Compare EnSync

EnSync is purpose-built for B2B partner ecosystem integration. See how we compare to other solutions:

## Quick Comparison

| **Solution** | **Best For** | **Key Difference** |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Traditional Integration** | 1-3 stable partners | EnSync scales to 100+ partners with same team |
| **SQS/Pub/Sub** | Internal microservices | EnSync is designed for external partners |
| **Apache Kafka** | High-throughput data pipelines | EnSync delivers high throughput for partner integrations |
| **Solace PubSub+** | Enterprise messaging hub | EnSync is partner-centric, not infrastructure-centric |
| **IPaaS (Zapier, MuleSoft)** | Standard SaaS app connections | EnSync enables custom partner ecosystems |

## When to Choose EnSync

Choose EnSync when you're:
- Building a B2B platform with partner integrations
- Planning to scale partner integrations (whether you have 1 partner or 100)
- Enabling partner self-service onboarding
- Need real-time, reliable messaging with guaranteed delivery
- Want to reduce engineering overhead for partner integrations
- Thinking integration-first from day one

## When to Choose Alternatives

**Traditional Integration:** You have 1-3 stable partners and no plans to scale

**SQS/Pub/Sub:** You need internal microservices messaging within your own infrastructure

**Kafka:** You need high-throughput event streaming for analytics, data pipelines, or internal event sourcing

**Solace PubSub+:** You're an enterprise with complex messaging needs across hybrid cloud environments

**IPaaS:** You need to connect standard SaaS apps without custom development (non-technical users)

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Messaging, Not Broadcasting
EnSync uses targeted delivery—you specify which partners receive each event (like WhatsApp), not broadcast to all subscribers (like radio). This ensures multi-tenant data isolation and privacy.

### 2. Two-Layer Access Control
Permissions (what partners CAN access) + Subscriptions (what they WANT to receive) = granular control over event delivery.

### 3. Partner-First Design
Built specifically for B2B partner integration, not adapted from internal messaging systems.

### 4. High Throughput at Scale
Delivers high throughput optimized for partner integration workloads, with horizontal scaling to handle growing partner ecosystems.

### 5. Self-Service Onboarding
Partners can onboard in 15 minutes using your embedded integration page—no engineering required.

### 6. Workspace Isolation
Each partner gets isolated workspace with their own observability, permissions, and event queues.

### 7. Guaranteed Delivery + Replay
90-day message retention with built-in replay for compliance and debugging.

### 8. Developer Experience
Lightweight SDK with consistent API across Node.js and Python—minutes to integrate, not weeks.
