## Event Types Overview

Events in EnSync follow a structured naming convention that helps organize and categorize different types of messages flowing through the system. A well-designed event naming system makes your integration ecosystem more intuitive and easier to manage.

## Event Naming Structure

Event names use a path-like structure to organize related events:

- `order/created`
- `order/updated`
- `order/shipped`
- `payment/completed`
- `user/registered`

This hierarchical structure helps quickly understand your event catalog and find specific events.

## Event Naming Best Practices

**Use clear, descriptive names:**
- Good: `order/shipped`, `payment/failed`, `user/updated`
- Avoid: `event1`, `data`, `msg`

**Group related events with prefixes:**
- All order events: `order/created`, `order/updated`, `order/cancelled`
- All payment events: `payment/initiated`, `payment/completed`, `payment/refunded`

**Use consistent verb tenses:**
- Past tense for completed actions: `order/created`, `payment/completed`
- Present tense for ongoing states: `inventory/low`, `system/healthy`

**Keep names concise:**
- Partners will type these names in their code
- Shorter names are easier to remember and less error-prone

## Event Versioning

If you need to make breaking changes to an event (like changing field types or removing fields), consider creating a new version:

- Current: `order/created`
- New version: `order/created/v2`

This allows:
- Existing partners to continue using the old version
- New partners to adopt the improved version
- Gradual migration without breaking existing integrations

Document the differences between versions in each event's description.

## Common Event Types

While you can create any event types that make sense for your business, here are some common categories:

### Order Events
- `order/created` - A new order has been placed
- `order/updated` - Order details have been modified
- `order/cancelled` - An order has been cancelled
- `order/shipped` - An order has been shipped
- `order/delivered` - An order has been delivered

### Payment Events
- `payment/initiated` - A payment process has started
- `payment/completed` - A payment has been successfully processed
- `payment/failed` - A payment attempt has failed
- `payment/refunded` - A refund has been issued

### User Events
- `user/registered` - A new user has signed up
- `user/updated` - User information has been changed
- `user/deleted` - A user account has been removed

### Inventory Events
- `inventory/updated` - Stock levels have changed
- `inventory/low` - Stock has fallen below threshold
- `inventory/replenished` - New stock has been added

## Next Steps

After defining your event types:
1. Configure [event permissions](/components/event-permissions) for your apps
2. Create apps that will publish these events
3. Set up integration pages to expose events to partners
