## What are Logs?

Logs are detailed records of all activity happening in your EnSync platform. They capture every event published, received, acknowledged, and any errors or connection changes. Logs are essential for:
- Troubleshooting integration issues
- Monitoring system health
- Auditing event delivery
- Understanding message flow
- Compliance and reporting

---

## Log Components

### Timestamp

The exact date and time when the log entry was created. Timestamps are in UTC and help you:
- Trace the sequence of events
- Identify when issues occurred
- Correlate logs across systems
- Generate time-based reports

### Log Level

The severity or type of log entry:

**DEBUG:**
Detailed technical information useful for development and troubleshooting. Shows internal system operations.

**INFO:**
General informational messages about normal operations. Examples:
- Event published successfully
- Connection established
- Subscription created

**WARN:**
Warning messages indicating potential issues that don't stop operations. Examples:
- Slow event delivery
- Retry attempts
- Deprecated feature usage

**ERROR:**
Error messages indicating failures that prevented an operation. Examples:
- Event delivery failed
- Authentication error
- Invalid event format

**CONNECTION_ESTABLISHED:**
Special log type indicating when apps or integrators successfully connect to EnSync.

### Type Code

A specific code identifying the type of operation or event. Common type codes:

**EVENT_PUBLISHED:**
An event was published to EnSync.

**EVENT_DELIVERED:**
An event was successfully delivered to a recipient.

**EVENT_ACKNOWLEDGED:**
A recipient confirmed receiving and processing an event.

**CONNECTION_OPENED:**
A new connection was established.

**CONNECTION_CLOSED:**
A connection was terminated.

**SUBSCRIPTION_CREATED:**
An app or integrator subscribed to an event.

**AUTHENTICATION_FAILED:**
An authentication attempt failed.

**PERMISSION_DENIED:**
An operation was blocked due to insufficient permissions.

### Producer

The entity that published or triggered the event. This could be:
- An app name (for events published by your apps)
- An integrator name (for events published by partners)
- "System" (for internal EnSync operations)

The producer field helps you identify the source of events and track which systems are most active.

### Consumer

The entity that received or should receive the event. This could be:
- An app name (for events delivered to your apps)
- An integrator name (for events delivered to partners)
- "Multiple" (for events with multiple recipients)

The consumer field helps you track event delivery and identify which systems are receiving data.

### Event Name

The name of the event being logged. Examples:
- `order/created`
- `payment/completed`
- `shipment/updated`

This helps you filter logs by specific event types.

### Message

A human-readable description of what happened. Examples:
- "Event published successfully"
- "Event delivered to consumer"
- "Connection established from 192.168.1.100"
- "Authentication failed: invalid credentials"

Messages provide context about the log entry.

### Metadata

Additional structured data about the log entry. This might include:
- Event payload (the actual data sent)
- Error details
- Connection information
- Retry attempts
- Delivery timestamps

Metadata is displayed in JSON format and can be expanded to view details.

---

## Viewing Logs

The Logs page displays a table with all log entries. Each row shows:
- Expandable arrow (click to see full metadata)
- Timestamp
- Log level
- Type code
- Metadata preview
- Producer
- Consumer
- Message

### Expanding Log Details

Click the arrow icon on the left of any log entry to expand it and see:
- Full metadata in formatted JSON
- Complete message text
- All associated fields

This is useful for debugging specific events or understanding exactly what data was sent.

## Filtering Logs

### Time Range Filter

**Start Date/Time:**
Set the beginning of the time range you want to view. Default is 1 hour ago.

**End Date/Time:**
Set the end of the time range. Default is now.

**Maximum Range:**
You can view logs for up to 7 days in a single query. If you need older logs, adjust the date range accordingly.

**Quick Tip:**
For real-time monitoring, set the start time to a few minutes ago and keep the end time at "now."

### Log Level Filter

Filter by severity:
- **ALL**: Show all log levels
- **DEBUG**: Show only debug messages
- **INFO**: Show only informational messages
- **WARN**: Show only warnings
- **ERROR**: Show only errors
- **CONNECTION_ESTABLISHED**: Show only connection events

Use this to focus on specific types of activity. For example:
- Select ERROR to troubleshoot failures
- Select CONNECTION_ESTABLISHED to monitor new connections
- Select INFO for general activity overview

### Search Query

Enter text to search across all log fields:
- Event names
- Producer names
- Consumer names
- Messages
- Metadata content

The search is case-insensitive and matches partial text. Examples:
- Search "order" to find all order-related events
- Search "failed" to find all failures
- Search a specific app name to see all its activity

### Applying Filters

After setting your filters:
1. Click "Search" or press Enter to apply them
2. The logs table updates to show matching entries
3. Pagination resets to page 1

**Clear Filters:**
Click "Clear" to reset all filters to defaults.

---

## Pagination

### Page Size

Choose how many log entries to display per page:
- 50 (default)
- 100
- 200

Larger page sizes load more data but may be slower.

### Page Navigation

Use the pagination controls at the bottom to:
- Go to the first page
- Go to the previous page
- Jump to a specific page number
- Go to the next page
- Go to the last page

The current page and total pages are displayed.

---

## Refreshing Logs

**Manual Refresh:**
Click the refresh button to reload logs with current filters.

**Auto-Refresh:**
Logs don't auto-refresh by default. For real-time monitoring, manually refresh periodically or adjust your time range to include recent activity.

**Last Refreshed:**
The timestamp showing when logs were last loaded appears at the top of the page.

---

## Common Log Patterns

### Successful Event Flow

A typical successful event delivery shows these log entries in sequence:

1. **EVENT_PUBLISHED** (INFO)
   - Producer: Your app
   - Message: "Event published successfully"

2. **EVENT_DELIVERED** (INFO)
   - Consumer: Partner/integrator
   - Message: "Event delivered to consumer"

3. **EVENT_ACKNOWLEDGED** (INFO)
   - Consumer: Partner/integrator
   - Message: "Event acknowledged by consumer"

### Failed Event Delivery

When event delivery fails, you'll see:

1. **EVENT_PUBLISHED** (INFO)
   - Event was published successfully

2. **EVENT_DELIVERY_FAILED** (ERROR)
   - Consumer: Intended recipient
   - Message: Reason for failure (e.g., "Consumer offline", "Connection timeout")

3. **EVENT_QUEUED_FOR_RETRY** (WARN)
   - Message: "Event queued for automatic retry"

EnSync automatically retries failed deliveries. Check logs later to see if retry succeeded.

### Authentication Issues

Authentication failures appear as:

**AUTHENTICATION_FAILED** (ERROR)
- Message: "Invalid credentials" or "Expired token"
- Metadata: Details about the authentication attempt

If you see repeated authentication failures:
- Verify the app or integrator is using correct credentials
- Check if credentials were regenerated
- Ensure the app/integrator hasn't been deleted

### Permission Errors

When an app tries to publish an event it doesn't have permission for:

**PERMISSION_DENIED** (ERROR)
- Producer: The app attempting to publish
- Event Name: The event they tried to publish
- Message: "App does not have permission to publish this event"

**Resolution:**
Edit the app's send permissions to include the event.

## Troubleshooting with Logs

### Event Not Delivered

**Steps:**
1. Filter logs by the event name
2. Look for EVENT_PUBLISHED entries
3. Check if EVENT_DELIVERED appears after it
4. If not delivered, look for ERROR logs explaining why

**Common causes:**
- Consumer is offline (will retry automatically)
- Consumer doesn't have receive permission
- Network issues (will retry automatically)

### App Can't Publish Events

**Steps:**
1. Search logs for the app name
2. Look for PERMISSION_DENIED or AUTHENTICATION_FAILED errors
3. Check the error message for details

**Common causes:**
- App doesn't have send permission for the event
- Invalid or expired credentials
- Event name typo (case-sensitive)

### Partner Not Receiving Events

**Steps:**
1. Filter by the partner's integrator name
2. Check for EVENT_DELIVERED logs
3. Look for CONNECTION_ESTABLISHED to verify they're connected
4. Search for ERROR logs related to that partner

**Common causes:**
- Partner hasn't subscribed to the event
- Partner's connection is inactive
- Event not exposed on their integration page

### High Error Rate

**Steps:**
1. Filter by ERROR level
2. Group errors by type code
3. Identify patterns (same producer, same consumer, same event)

**Common causes:**
- System-wide issue (many different errors)
- Specific app misconfigured (errors from one producer)
- Partner system down (errors to one consumer)

## Log Retention

Logs are retained for **90 days** by default. After 90 days, logs are automatically archived and may not be accessible through the dashboard.

For long-term log retention:
- Export logs regularly
- Set up log forwarding to external systems
- Contact support about extended retention options

---

## Exporting Logs

While there's no built-in export button, you can:
- Copy log data from the table
- Use the API to fetch logs programmatically
- Set up log forwarding to external logging systems (Datadog, Splunk, etc.)

For bulk exports or automated log collection, contact support for API access details.

---

## Log Limits

Depending on your EnSync plan, you may have limits on:
- Log retention period
- Number of log queries per day
- Log detail level (some plans may not show DEBUG logs)

Check your plan details in the dashboard. If you need more logging capabilities, upgrade prompts appear when you approach limits.

---

## Best Practices

**Regular Monitoring:**
Check logs daily for ERROR entries to catch issues early.

**Use Specific Filters:**
Instead of viewing all logs, filter by:
- Specific apps or integrators
- Specific event types
- Error level only

**Correlate with Analytics:**
If analytics show a drop in activity, check logs for errors during that time period.

**Document Patterns:**
Keep notes on common error patterns and their resolutions for faster troubleshooting.

**Set Up Alerts:**
If your plan supports it, configure alerts for critical errors so you're notified immediately.

**Time Zone Awareness:**
Logs are in UTC. Convert to your local time zone when correlating with external systems.

## Understanding Idempotency Keys (Idem)

Many log entries include an idempotency key (Idem) in the metadata. This unique identifier:
- Ensures the same event isn't processed twice
- Helps trace an event through the entire system
- Enables request-response correlation

If you're troubleshooting a specific event, search logs by its Idem to see its complete journey through EnSync.

## Next Steps

Use logs to:
1. Monitor system health daily
2. Troubleshoot integration issues
3. Verify event delivery
4. Audit compliance requirements
5. Optimize app and integration performance
