## What are Apps?

Apps represent your internal systems, services, or applications that connect to EnSync to publish or receive events. Each app is an authenticated entity with specific permissions controlling what events it can send and receive.

Think of apps as your own services that need to communicate through EnSync:
- Your order management system
- Your payment processing service
- Your inventory tracking system
- Your notification service
- Your analytics platform

Apps are different from partners or integrators—apps are systems you control, while partners are external entities connecting to you through integration pages.

---

## App Components

### App Name

A descriptive identifier for your app. This helps you quickly recognize which system or service the app represents in your dashboard.

Examples:
- "Order Management System"
- "Payment Processor"
- "Inventory Service"
- "Customer Notifications"

### App Key (Access Key)

A unique authentication credential generated when you create an app. This key is used by your system to authenticate with EnSync when publishing or subscribing to events.

**Important:** The app key is shown only once when the app is created. Store it securely—you won't be able to see it again. If you lose it, you'll need to regenerate the key.

### Public Key

Part of EnSync's hybrid encryption system. Your app's public key is shared with other apps and integrators who want to send encrypted messages to your app. 

**Important:** You only need your app's public key if you plan to receive encrypted messages. When sending messages to other apps or integrators, you'll use *their* public key to encrypt the message, not your own. Your app's public key is only used by others who want to send messages to you.

### Decrypt Key (Private Key)

The private half of the encryption key pair. This key is used by your app to decrypt incoming messages that were encrypted with your app's public key.

**Critical:** Store this key securely. Anyone with access to this key can decrypt messages intended for your app. Like the app key, it's shown only once during creation.

**When to use:** You only need the decrypt key when receiving encrypted messages. When sending messages, you'll use the recipient's public key for encryption, not your decrypt key.

### Permissions

Apps have two types of permissions that control which events they can interact with:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Send Permissions" icon="paper-plane">
    Controls which events the app can publish to EnSync
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Receive Permissions" icon="inbox">
    Controls which events the app can subscribe to and receive
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

For detailed information about event permissions, see the [Event Permissions](/components/event-permissions) documentation.

## Creating an App

When you click "Create New App," a modal appears with:

**App Name Field:**
Enter a descriptive name for your app. This is required and helps you identify the app in your dashboard.

**Send Events Section:**
A multi-select dropdown showing all available events in your workspace. Select which events this app should be allowed to publish. You can search for events by typing in the search box.

**Receive Events Section:**
Another multi-select dropdown for choosing which events this app should be allowed to receive. These are the events your app will be notified about.

**After clicking "Create App":**
A success modal displays showing:
- App Name (confirmation of what you created)
- App Key (authentication credential - copy this immediately)
- Public Key (for encryption - copy this)
- Decrypt Key (private key for decryption - copy this immediately)

Each field has a copy button. **Copy all three keys and store them securely.** You won't be able to view them again after closing this modal.

## App Dashboard and Analytics

The Apps Analytics section shows metrics for your apps:

### Apps Published Events
The total number of events published by the selected app (or all apps if "All Apps" is selected). This shows how active your app is in sending data to EnSync.

### Apps Received Events
The total number of events received by the selected app. This shows how much data your app is consuming from EnSync.

### Active Subscribers
The number of active connections currently subscribed to events from this app. This indicates how many partners or other apps are actively listening to events from this app.

### App Traffic Chart
A line chart showing published vs. received events over time (default: last 5 days). You can:
- Set a custom date range using the Start and End date pickers
- Clear the date range to return to the default view
- See trends in your app's activity

The chart helps you:
- Identify spikes in activity
- Spot when an app stops publishing or receiving
- Compare send vs. receive patterns

### Events Table
A detailed breakdown showing:
- **Event Name**: The specific event type
- **Published**: How many times this app published this event
- **Received**: How many times this app received this event
- **Total**: Sum of published and received

This table helps you understand which events are most active for this app.

## Editing Apps

Click the three-dot menu next to an app and select "Edit" to modify:

**App Name:**
Change the display name of the app. This doesn't affect authentication or permissions.

**Send Permissions:**
Add or remove events the app can publish. Changes take effect immediately:
- Adding an event: App can now publish it
- Removing an event: App can no longer publish it (attempts will fail)

**Receive Permissions:**
Add or remove events the app can receive. Changes take effect immediately:
- Adding an event: App will start receiving it
- Removing an event: App will stop receiving it

**Note:** You cannot view or change the app key, public key, or decrypt key when editing. These can only be regenerated (which creates new keys).

---

## Regenerating App Keys

If your app key is compromised or lost, you can regenerate it:

1. Click the three-dot menu next to the app
2. Select "Regenerate Key"
3. A confirmation modal appears warning that the old key will stop working
4. Confirm regeneration
5. A new modal displays the new keys (app key, public key, decrypt key)

**Important:**
- The old app key becomes invalid immediately
- Any systems using the old key will stop working until updated
- Copy the new keys immediately—they won't be shown again
- Update your systems with the new credentials as soon as possible

---

## Deleting Apps

When you delete an app:

**What happens:**
- The app is permanently removed from your workspace
- All authentication credentials are invalidated
- The app can no longer publish or receive events
- Any active connections are immediately terminated

**Before deleting:**
- Ensure no systems are actively using this app's credentials
- Check the analytics to see if the app is still active
- Consider disabling the app first (by removing all permissions) to test impact

**The deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.**

---

## App Status Indicators

Apps don't have explicit online/offline status, but you can infer their state from:

**Active Subscribers:**
If this number is greater than 0, the app has active connections listening for events.

**Recent Activity:**
Check the traffic chart and events table:
- Recent published events: App is actively sending data
- Recent received events: App is actively consuming data
- No recent activity: App may be offline or idle

**Last Active Timestamp:**
Shown in the apps list, this indicates when the app last interacted with EnSync.

---

## Apps vs. Integration Pages

**Apps:**
- Systems you control
- You create and manage their credentials
- You define their permissions explicitly
- Used for your internal services

**Integration Pages:**
- Portals for external partners
- Partners generate their own credentials
- Partners choose which events to subscribe to (from what you expose)
- Used for external integrations

An app can be used to power an integration page, but they serve different purposes.

---

## Security Best Practices

**Protect Your Keys:**
- Store app keys, public keys, and decrypt keys in secure credential management systems
- Never commit keys to version control
- Rotate keys periodically, especially if team members leave

**Principle of Least Privilege:**
- Only grant send permissions for events the app actually publishes
- Only grant receive permissions for events the app actually needs
- Review permissions regularly and remove unused ones

**Monitor Activity:**
- Regularly check app analytics for unusual patterns
- Set up alerts for unexpected spikes or drops in activity
- Investigate apps with zero activity—they may be misconfigured

**Key Rotation:**
- Regenerate keys if you suspect compromise
- Have a process to update systems with new keys quickly
- Test key rotation in development before doing it in production

---

## Troubleshooting

**App can't publish events:**
- Verify the app has send permission for that event
- Check that the app key is correct and not expired
- Ensure the event name matches exactly (case-sensitive)

**App not receiving events:**
- Verify the app has receive permission for that event
- Check that the app is actively connected and subscribing
- Ensure other apps/partners are actually publishing that event

**Authentication errors:**
- App key may be incorrect or regenerated
- App may have been deleted
- Credentials may be expired (check with support)

**No activity showing in analytics:**
- App may not be connected
- Permissions may be misconfigured
- Events may not be flowing (check other apps/partners)

---

## API Integration

When integrating your systems with EnSync using app credentials:

**Authentication:**
Include the app key in your API requests (typically in an Authorization header or as a credential parameter).

**Publishing Events:**
Use the EnSync SDK or API to publish events. You'll need:
- App key for authentication
- Event name (must match your send permissions)
- Event payload (data to send)
- Optional: recipient list (specific partners to receive this event)

**Subscribing to Events:**
Establish a connection to EnSync using:
- App key for authentication
- List of events to subscribe to (must match your receive permissions)
- Callback URL or WebSocket connection to receive events

**Encrypting & Decrypting Messages:**
When sending encrypted events:
- Use the recipient's public key to encrypt the message payload
- You don't need your own public key to send messages

When receiving encrypted events:
- Use your decrypt key (private key) to decrypt the message payload
- EnSync SDKs handle this automatically if configured with your keys

---

## App Limits

Depending on your EnSync plan, you may have limits on:
- Number of apps you can create
- Number of events per app
- Message throughput per app

Check your plan details in the dashboard. If you hit limits, you'll see a notice prompting you to upgrade.

## Next Steps

After creating apps:
1. Integrate them into your systems using the provided credentials
2. Test publishing and receiving events in a development environment
3. Monitor the analytics dashboard to ensure events are flowing correctly
4. Set up integration pages to allow partners to connect to your apps
5. Review and adjust permissions as your needs evolve
