## What are Integrations?

Integrations (also called Integration Pages) are self-service portals where external partners can connect to your EnSync platform. Each integration page is a unique URL you share with partners, allowing them to browse your event catalog, generate their own credentials, and subscribe to eventsâ€”all without requiring engineering work from your team.

Think of an integration page as a storefront for your events. Partners visit the page, see what's available, and connect themselves.

---

## Integration Components

### Integration Name

A descriptive identifier for the integration page. This helps you organize multiple integration pages for different partner types or use cases.

Examples:
- "Payment Partners Integration"
- "Shipping Providers Portal"
- "Analytics Partners Access"
- "Public API Integration"

### Integration URL

A unique, shareable URL that partners use to access the integration page. The URL typically follows the format:
```
https://ensync.cloud/integrate/{integration-id}
```

Partners who visit this URL can:
- Browse available events
- Read event descriptions and schemas
- Generate their own app credentials
- Subscribe to events they need

### Exposed Events (Send Permissions)

The list of events you've chosen to make available on this integration page. These are events that partners can subscribe to and receive from you.

When you expose events, partners see:
- Event names
- Event descriptions
- Event schemas (data structure)
- Example payloads

You control exactly which events appear on each integration page, allowing you to create different pages for different partner types.

### Callback Events (Receive Permissions)

Events that partners connecting through this integration page can publish back to you. This enables bi-directional communication.

For example, if you expose `order/created` to shipping partners, you might allow them to publish `shipment/updated` back to you.

### Integration Webhook (Optional)

A callback URL where EnSync sends notifications about integration activity, such as:
- New partner connected
- Partner subscribed to an event
- Partner published an event
- Partner disconnected

This helps you track integration activity without constantly checking the dashboard.

### Integration Metadata

Optional JSON data for storing additional information about the integration:
- Partner type
- Integration purpose
- Custom configuration
- Internal notes

This metadata is for your reference and isn't visible to partners.

---

## Creating an Integration Page

When you create a new integration, you'll configure:

**Integration Name:**
A descriptive name to help you identify this integration page in your dashboard.

**Description (Optional):**
Internal notes about the purpose of this integration page.

**Send Events:**
Select which events partners can subscribe to. These events will be visible in the event catalog on the integration page.

**Receive Events:**
Select which events partners can publish back to you. This defines what data partners can send.

**Webhook URL (Optional):**
If you want to receive notifications about integration activity, provide a webhook URL.

**Color and Logo (Optional):**
Customize the appearance of the integration page for branding.

**After creation:**
The integration page is immediately available at its unique URL. You can copy this URL and share it with partners.

---

## Integration Dashboard

The Integrations section shows metrics for your integration pages:

### Total Integrators

The total number of partners (integrators) who have connected through all your integration pages. This includes active, pending, and disabled integrators.

### Active Integrators

Partners who are currently connected and actively exchanging events. These integrators have:
- Generated credentials
- Established connections
- Published or received events recently

### Pending Integrators

Partners who have started the connection process but haven't completed it. They may have:
- Generated credentials but not connected yet
- Connected but not subscribed to any events
- Subscribed but not yet published or received events

### Disabled Integrators

Partners whose access has been disabled. They can no longer:
- Publish events
- Receive events
- Establish new connections

Disabled integrators retain their credentials but cannot use them until re-enabled.

---

## Managing Integrators

Integrators are partners who have connected through your integration pages. Each integration page has its own list of integrators.

### Viewing Integrators

Click "Manage" on an integration to see all partners connected through that page. For each integrator, you'll see:

**App Name:**
The name the partner chose when generating their credentials.

**Email:**
The email address associated with the integrator (if provided).

**Status:**
- **Active**: Currently connected and exchanging events
- **Pending**: Credentials generated but not fully active
- **Inactive**: Not currently connected
- **Disabled**: Access revoked by you

**Last Active:**
Timestamp of the last interaction with EnSync.

**Created At:**
When the integrator first connected.

**Key:**
A unique identifier for this integrator's credentials.

### Integrator Analytics

Select a specific integrator to view their activity:

**Integrator Events Published:**
Number of events this partner has published to you through EnSync.

**Integrator Events Received:**
Number of events this partner has received from you.

**Traffic Chart:**
Visual representation of the integrator's publish/receive activity over time. You can:
- Set custom date ranges
- Compare published vs. received trends
- Identify activity patterns

---

## Integrator Actions

### Editing Integrator Details

You can update:
- Integrator name (for your reference)
- Description
- Custom metadata

**Note:** You cannot change which events an integrator can access. Event permissions are controlled at the integration page level, not per integrator.

### Changing Integrator Status

**Disabling an Integrator:**
Temporarily revokes access without deleting the integrator. The partner:
- Cannot publish or receive events
- Cannot establish new connections
- Retains their credentials (can be re-enabled later)

Use this when:
- A partner needs temporary suspension
- You're troubleshooting issues
- A partner's contract is on hold

**Enabling an Integrator:**
Restores access for a previously disabled integrator. They can immediately resume publishing and receiving events.

### Removing an Integrator

Permanently deletes the integrator and invalidates their credentials. The partner:
- Loses all access immediately
- Must reconnect through the integration page to regain access
- Will receive new credentials if they reconnect

**This action is permanent and cannot be undone.**

Use this when:
- A partnership has ended
- Credentials are compromised
- The integrator is no longer needed

---

## Integration Page Features

### Event Catalog

Partners visiting your integration page see a catalog of available events with:
- Event names (organized by prefix)
- Descriptions explaining what each event represents
- Schemas showing the data structure
- Example payloads

The catalog is searchable and filterable, making it easy for partners to find relevant events.

### Self-Service Credential Generation

Partners can generate their own credentials directly from the integration page:

1. Partner visits the integration URL
2. Provides their email and app name
3. Clicks "Generate Credentials"
4. Receives app key, public key, and decrypt key
5. Can immediately start integrating

**You receive a notification** (via webhook if configured) when a new partner connects.

### Event Subscription

After generating credentials, partners can:
- Browse the event catalog
- Select events they want to receive
- Subscribe with one click
- Start receiving events immediately

Partners can modify their subscriptions at any time through the integration page.

---

## Multiple Integration Pages

You can create multiple integration pages for different purposes:

**By Partner Type:**
- Payment processors see payment-related events
- Shipping providers see order and shipment events
- Analytics partners see all events

**By Access Level:**
- Public integration page with limited events
- Premium partner page with full event access
- Internal testing page for development

**By Region:**
- North America partners
- European partners
- Asia-Pacific partners

Each integration page has its own:
- Unique URL
- Event catalog
- List of integrators
- Analytics

---

## Integration Page Customization

### Branding

**Color:**
Set a primary color for the integration page to match your brand.

**Logo URL:**
Provide a URL to your logo image. It appears at the top of the integration page.

**Description:**
Add a welcome message or instructions for partners visiting the page.

### Event Organization

Group related events with prefixes:
- `order/*` - All order-related events
- `payment/*` - All payment events
- `user/*` - All user events

Partners can filter by these prefixes to quickly find relevant events.

---

## Security and Access Control

### Integration-Level Permissions

Permissions are set at the integration page level, not per integrator. All partners connecting through the same integration page have access to the same events.

If you need different permission levels, create separate integration pages.

### Credential Security

**Partners are responsible for:**
- Storing their credentials securely
- Not sharing credentials
- Rotating credentials if compromised

**You are responsible for:**
- Monitoring integrator activity
- Disabling suspicious integrators
- Removing integrators when partnerships end

### Audit Trail

EnSync logs all integration activity:
- When integrators connect
- Which events they subscribe to
- When they publish or receive events
- When their status changes

Access these logs in the Logs section for compliance and troubleshooting.

---

## Webhooks and Notifications

If you configure a webhook URL for an integration, EnSync sends notifications for:

**New Integrator Connected:**
```json
{
  "event": "integrator.connected",
  "integration_id": "...",
  "integrator_id": "...",
  "app_name": "Partner App",
  "email": "partner@example.com",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Integrator Subscribed to Event:**
```json
{
  "event": "integrator.subscribed",
  "integration_id": "...",
  "integrator_id": "...",
  "event_name": "order/created",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:35:00Z"
}
```

**Integrator Status Changed:**
```json
{
  "event": "integrator.status_changed",
  "integration_id": "...",
  "integrator_id": "...",
  "old_status": "active",
  "new_status": "disabled",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z"
}
```

Use these webhooks to:
- Notify your team when new partners connect
- Trigger onboarding workflows
- Update internal systems
- Monitor integration health

## Troubleshooting

**Partner can't access integration page:**
- Verify the URL is correct
- Check that the integration page hasn't been deleted
- Ensure the page is active (not disabled)

**Partner can't generate credentials:**
- Check integration page limits (plan-based)
- Verify the page allows new integrators
- Look for error messages in browser console

**Partner not receiving events:**
- Verify they've subscribed to the events
- Check that events are being published by your apps
- Ensure the partner's connection is active
- Review the integrator's receive permissions

**Events not flowing to partner:**
- Confirm the event is exposed on the integration page
- Check that your apps have permission to publish the event
- Verify the partner is actively connected
- Review logs for delivery errors

---

## Integration Limits

Depending on your EnSync plan, you may have limits on:
- Number of integration pages
- Number of integrators per page
- Number of events per page
- Total integrator connections

Check your plan details in the dashboard. Upgrade prompts appear when you approach limits.

---

## Best Practices

**Clear Event Descriptions:**
Write descriptions that help partners understand when events are triggered and what data they contain.

**Logical Event Grouping:**
Use consistent prefixes to organize events by domain (order, payment, user, etc.).

**Monitor New Integrators:**
Review new connections regularly to ensure they're legitimate partners.

**Regular Permission Audits:**
Periodically review which events are exposed on each integration page and remove unused ones.

**Webhook Monitoring:**
Set up webhook handlers to track integration activity and respond to new connections promptly.

**Partner Communication:**
Provide documentation alongside your integration page URL explaining how to use your events effectively.

---

## Next Steps

After creating integration pages:
1. Share the integration URL with partners
2. Monitor for new integrator connections
3. Review integrator activity in the analytics dashboard
4. Respond to webhook notifications
5. Adjust exposed events based on partner feedback
