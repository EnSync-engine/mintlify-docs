## Overview

This Service Level Agreement (SLA) describes EnSync's commitments regarding platform availability, performance, and support for our cloud-hosted service.

## Uptime Guarantee

### 99.99% Uptime Commitment

EnSync commits to **99.99% uptime** for our platform, measured monthly. This applies to:
- Event publishing and delivery
- SDK connections
- Dashboard access
- API availability

### Plan-Specific SLA Coverage

| Plan | SLA Coverage | Uptime Guarantee |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| **Starter** | No formal SLA | Best effort - we aim for high availability |
| **Startup** | No formal SLA | Best effort - we aim for high availability |
| **Scaleup** | ✅ Covered | 99.99% uptime |
| **Enterprise** | ✅ Covered | 99.99% uptime |

<Note>
While Starter and Startup plans don't have formal SLA coverage, we maintain the same infrastructure and aim to provide high availability at all times.
</Note>

## Performance Commitments

### Event Delivery Latency

EnSync targets **50ms per message** for event delivery latency (publish to delivery).

<Info>
In practice, latency is typically much lower. The 50ms target accounts for our alpha stage with multi-region hosting as we continue to optimize performance.
</Info>

### High Throughput

EnSync delivers high throughput optimized for partner integration workloads, with horizontal scaling to handle growing partner ecosystems.

## Data Retention

Data retention varies by plan tier:

| Plan | Event Retention | Log Retention |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| **Starter** | 3 days | 3 days |
| **Startup** | 30 days | 30 days |
| **Scaleup** | 90 days | 90 days |
| **Enterprise (Cloud)** | Up to 1 year | Up to 1 year |
| **Enterprise (Self-Hosted)** | Unlimited | Unlimited |

## Maintenance Windows

### Scheduled Maintenance

EnSync performs scheduled maintenance to ensure platform reliability and security.

**Advance Notice:**
- **Starter**: No advance notice required
- **Startup**: 1 week advance notice
- **Scaleup**: 1 week advance notice
- **Enterprise**: 1 month advance notice

**Maintenance Impact:**
- Scheduled maintenance windows are excluded from uptime calculations
- We aim to minimize disruption during maintenance
- Critical security updates may require shorter notice periods

## Service Credits

### SLA Breach Compensation

If EnSync fails to meet the 99.99% uptime commitment for Scaleup or Enterprise plans, we provide service credits in the form of **additional event bandwidth**.

**Credit Calculation:**

| Monthly Uptime | Service Credit |
|----------------|----------------|
| < 99.99% but ≥ 99.9% | 10% of monthly event bandwidth |
| < 99.9% but ≥ 99.0% | 25% of monthly event bandwidth |
| < 99.0% | 50% of monthly event bandwidth |

**To Request Credits:**
1. Contact support@ensync.cloud within 30 days of the incident
2. Provide details of the service disruption
3. Credits will be applied to your next billing cycle
