## Overview

This guide covers self-service partner integration using integration pages. For manual onboarding, see [Manually Onboard a Partner](/how-to/manual-onboard-partner).

## Self-Service Integration

### 1. Share Integration Page

Send your partner the integration page URL:
```
https://ensync.cloud/integrate/{integration-id}
```

### 2. Partner Onboards Themselves

The partner:
1. Visits the integration page
2. Browses available events
3. Clicks "Connect"
4. Receives their credentials (appKey, appSecret, appId)
5. Subscribes to events they need

### 3. Receive Webhook Notification

When the partner connects, EnSync sends a webhook to your system with:
- Partner's appId
- Connection timestamp
- Subscribed events

### 4. Start Publishing Events

Begin publishing events to the partner's appId:

```javascript
await client.publish(
  "order/created",
  ["partner-app-id"],  // From webhook
  orderData
);
```

## Verification

After integration, verify the connection:

### Check Integration Status

In the EnSync Dashboard:
1. Navigate to **Integrations** tab
2. View list of onboarded partners
3. Check partner status (active/inactive)
4. Review connection timestamp

### Test Event Delivery

1. Check **Logs** dashboard for connection events
2. Publish a test event to the partner
3. Confirm partner receives the event
4. If bidirectional, have partner publish a test event

## Troubleshooting

**Partner not receiving events:**
- Verify appId is correct in publish calls
- Check partner's receive permissions
- Review Logs for delivery errors

**Connection failures:**
- Verify credentials are correct
- Check app hasn't been deleted
- Ensure no workers are using old credentials
