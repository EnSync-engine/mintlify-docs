## Overview

Manual onboarding is useful when partners need assistance, custom configuration, or when self-service isn't available. This guide walks through the complete process.

## Prerequisites

- Access to EnSync Dashboard
- Partner's contact information
- List of events partner needs to receive
- List of events partner will publish (if bidirectional)

## Steps

### 1. Collect Partner Information

Use the partner onboarding form in the EnSync Dashboard to collect:
- Partner company name
- Contact information
- Events they need to receive
- Events they will publish (if bidirectional)
- Any special requirements

### 2. Create Partner App

The dashboard automatically creates an app and generates:
- appKey (for authentication)
- appId (public identifier)
- appSecret (for decryption)

### 3. Securely Share Credentials

Send the partner their credentials through a secure channel:

**Share with partner:**
- appKey (for authentication)
- appSecret (for decryption)

**Security best practices:**
- Use encrypted email or secure file sharing
- Never share via plain email or Slack
- Consider using password-protected documents
- Share credentials separately from instructions

### 4. Provide Integration Instructions

Send the partner:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
    ```javascript
    const { EnSyncClient } = require('@ensync/node');

    const client = await EnSyncClient.create({
      appKey: "their-app-key",
      appSecret: "their-app-secret"
    });

    // Subscribe to events
    await client.subscribe("order/*", {
      autoAck: false
    });

    client.on(async (event) => {
      console.log("Received:", event.eventName, event.payload);
      await event.ack();
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    from ensync import EnSyncClient

    client = await EnSyncClient.create(
        app_key="their-app-key",
        app_secret="their-app-secret"
    )

    # Subscribe to events
    await client.subscribe("order/*", auto_ack=False)

    async def handle_event(event):
        print(f"Received: {event.event_name}", event.payload)
        await event.ack()

    client.on(handle_event)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 5. Share Your appId (If Bidirectional)

If the partner will publish events to you:

1. Get your appId from your app in the Dashboard
2. Share it with the partner
3. Provide example of how to publish:

```javascript
await client.publish(
  "shipment/updated",
  ["your-app-id"],  // Your appId
  shipmentData
);
```

### 5. Test the Integration

**Send test event to partner:**
```javascript
await client.publish(
  "test/event",
  ["partner-app-id"],
  { message: "Test event" }
);
```

**Verify in Logs:**
1. Open Logs dashboard
2. Filter by partner's app name
3. Confirm event was delivered
4. Check for any errors

**Have partner confirm receipt:**
- Partner should see the test event in their logs
- Partner should successfully process and acknowledge it

### 7. Go Live

Once testing is successful:
1. Remove test event subscriptions
2. Start publishing real events
3. Monitor Logs for first few hours
4. Confirm partner is processing events correctly

## Post-Onboarding

### Monitor Partner Activity

In the EnSync Dashboard:
- Navigate to **Integrations** tab to view onboarded partners
- Check partner status (active/inactive)
- Review Logs for delivery status
- Monitor error rates
- Review event throughput

### Update Permissions

If partner needs access to additional events:
1. Navigate to Apps section
2. Find partner's app
3. Update send/receive permissions
4. No need to regenerate credentials

### Rotate Credentials

If credentials are compromised:
1. Create new app in the Dashboard
2. Share new credentials with partner
3. Partner updates their configuration
4. Delete old app after transition

## Troubleshooting

**Partner can't connect:**
- Verify credentials are correct (no typos)
- Check app hasn't been deleted
- Ensure partner is using correct SDK version

**Partner not receiving events:**
- Verify you're using correct appId in publish calls
- Check partner's receive permissions include the event
- Review Logs for delivery errors

**Permission errors:**
- Verify partner's send/receive permissions
- Check event path matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure event definition exists (if using schemas)
