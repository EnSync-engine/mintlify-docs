## Overview

The Logs dashboard provides comprehensive visibility into all EnSync activity, making it easy to identify and diagnose issues.

## Quick Diagnosis

### 1. Filter by Error Level

In the Logs dashboard:
- Set **Level** filter to "Error" or "Critical"
- Review recent errors
- Look for patterns or repeated failures

### 2. Check Event Delivery Failures

Filter by **Type**: "Event Logs"
- Look for delivery failures
- Check error messages for reasons:
  - Invalid appId
  - Permission denied
  - Partner offline/disconnected
  - Schema validation failure

### 3. Review Connection Issues

Filter by **Type**: "App Logs"
- Look for connection/disconnection events
- Check authentication failures
- Identify credential issues

## Common Issues

### Events Not Being Delivered

**Symptoms**: Partner reports missing events

**Diagnosis**:
1. Filter logs by event name
2. Check if events were published
3. Look for delivery errors
4. Verify recipient appId is correct

**Common Causes**:
- Wrong appId in publish call
- Partner's receive permissions don't include event
- Partner disconnected

### Schema Validation Errors

**Symptoms**: Publish calls failing

**Diagnosis**:
1. Filter logs by "Error" level
2. Look for "Schema validation failed" messages
3. Check error details for which fields failed

**Common Causes**:
- Payload doesn't match event definition
- Missing required fields
- Wrong data types (e.g., string instead of number)

### Permission Denied Errors

**Symptoms**: "Permission denied" errors in logs

**Diagnosis**:
1. Filter by error level
2. Find permission denied messages
3. Check which app and event path

**Common Causes**:
- App doesn't have send permission for event
- Partner doesn't have receive permission
- Event path typo

### High Error Rate

**Symptoms**: Many errors in short time period

**Diagnosis**:
1. Set time range to last hour
2. Filter by "Error" level
3. Look for common error messages
4. Check if errors are from specific app or event

**Common Causes**:
- Deployment issue (bad code pushed)
- Partner system down
- Schema change without updating publishers

## Advanced Debugging

- Specific event IDs (idem)

3. Choose JSON format
4. Analyze offline or share with support
