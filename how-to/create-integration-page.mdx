## Overview

Integration pages allow partners to self-onboard to your platform without engineering involvement. Partners can browse your event catalog, generate credentials, and subscribe to eventsâ€”all through a branded portal.

## Steps

### 1. Navigate to Integrations

Open the EnSync Dashboard and go to the **Integrations** section.

### 2. Create New Integration Page

Click **"Create Integration Page"** and provide:
- **Name**: Descriptive identifier (e.g., "Payment Partners Portal")
- **Description**: What this integration is for

### 3. Select Events to Expose

Choose which events partners can subscribe to:
- Browse your event catalog
- Select events relevant to this partner type
- Partners will see these events with their schemas and descriptions

### 4. Configure Callback Events

Optionally, allow partners to publish events back to you:
- Select which event types partners can publish
- Enables bidirectional communication

### 5. Customize Branding

Personalize the integration page:
- Upload your logo
- Set brand colors
- Add custom welcome message

### 6. Generate Integration URL

The dashboard generates a unique URL:
```
https://ensync.cloud/integrate/{integration-id}
```

Share this URL with partners for self-service onboarding.

## Use Cases

**Payment Partners**: Expose `order/created`, `order/updated` events; allow `payment/completed` callbacks

**Shipping Providers**: Expose `order/shipped` events; allow `shipment/updated` callbacks

**Analytics Partners**: Expose all events; no callback events needed

## Next Steps

- Share the integration URL with partners
- Monitor partner connections in the Dashboard
- View integration analytics to track usage
