## What is EnSync?

EnSync is a powerful real-time event delivery and integration engine designed to connect systems seamlessly. It enables businesses to build truly reactive applications by facilitating reliable, structured message exchange between internal and third-party systems. Unlike traditional integration platforms, EnSync doesn't disrupt existing architectures but rather enhances them by enabling applications to send and receive events as if they were native to the architecture.

<Note>
EnSync is designed for integration engineers and developers who need to connect systems reliably and securely at scale.
