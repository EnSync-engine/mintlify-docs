Pause temporarily stops your client from receiving new events while keeping the subscription active. Use this for maintenance windows or when you need to temporarily halt processing. Unlike unsubscribe, paused events remain queued and will be delivered when you continue.

## Usage

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
    ```javascript
    const subscription = await client.subscribe("inventory/updates");

    // Pause when needed
    await subscription.pause();
    await performMaintenance();

    // Resume receiving events
    await subscription.continue();
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    subscription = await client.subscribe("inventory/updates")

    # Pause when needed
    await subscription.pause()
    await perform_maintenance()

    # Resume receiving events
    await subscription.continue_subscription()
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `pause()` | Stop receiving new events |
| `continue()` | Resume receiving events |

## When to Use

- **Maintenance windows**: Pause during system updates or database migrations
- **Temporary halt**: Stop processing while performing operations that require no new events
- **Controlled restart**: Pause before restarting to avoid losing in-flight events

<Note>
Pause affects only this client instance. Your other client instances sharing the same appKey continue receiving events.
