Unsubscribe stops the subscription and cleans up resources. Use this when you no longer need to receive events from a specific event path, such as when shutting down a service, removing a feature, or cleaning up temporary subscriptions.

## Usage

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
    ```javascript
    const subscription = await client.subscribe("order/created");

    // Later, when done
    await subscription.unsubscribe();
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    subscription = await client.subscribe("order/created")

    # Later, when done
    await subscription.unsubscribe()
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## When to Use

- **Service shutdown**: Clean up before stopping your application
- **Feature removal**: Stop receiving events for deprecated features
- **Temporary subscriptions**: End subscriptions created for one-time operations
- **Resource cleanup**: Free up connections and memory

## Pause vs Unsubscribe

| Action | Events Queued | Reconnect | Use Case |
|--------|---------------|-----------|----------|
| **Pause** | Yes | `continue()` | Temporary stop, maintenance |
| **Unsubscribe** | No | New subscription | Permanent stop, cleanup |

<Note>
After unsubscribing, you'll need to create a new subscription to receive events again.
