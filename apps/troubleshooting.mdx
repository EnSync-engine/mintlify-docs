## App Permission Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="ban" title="App permission errors">
    ### App Permission Errors
    
    If you're experiencing permission errors with your app, check the following:
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Verify Send Permissions">
        Ensure the app has the correct send permissions configured. Go to the app's details page in the management console and check the "Send Permissions" section.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Verify Receive Permissions">
        Ensure the app has the correct receive permissions configured. Go to the app's details page and check the "Receive Permissions" section.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Check for Recent Changes">
        If permissions were working before, check if someone recently modified the app's permissions. Look at the audit logs to see when changes were made.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Verify Event Names">
        Ensure the event names in your permissions match exactly what you need. Event names are case-sensitive and must match the format used in your systems.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="triangle-exclamation" title="Events not showing in analytics">
    ### Events Not Showing in Analytics
    
    If events aren't appearing in your app analytics:
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Check Time Range">
        Verify you're looking at the correct time range in the analytics dashboard. The default view might not include your recent activity.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Verify App Selection">
        Make sure you've selected the correct app in the analytics dashboard filters.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Check Event Type Filters">
        Ensure you haven't applied filters that might be excluding the events you're looking for.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Allow for Processing Time">
        Analytics data might have a slight delay before appearing. Wait a few minutes and refresh the dashboard.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Verify App Status">
        Check that the app is active and hasn't been disabled or deleted.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

## App Credential Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="App key problems">
    ### App Key Problems
    
    If you're having issues with your app keys:
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Verify App Key Visibility">
        Remember that app keys are only shown once when created or regenerated. If you didn't save it, you'll need to regenerate it from the app management interface.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Check App Status">
        Ensure the app hasn't been deleted or disabled. If an app is deleted, all its credentials become invalid.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Regenerate Key if Needed">
        If you suspect the key might be compromised or lost, regenerate it from the app management interface.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Update Systems After Regeneration">
        After regenerating a key, remember to update all systems using that key. The old key will immediately stop working.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    
    <Warning>
      Regenerating a key immediately invalidates the old one. Make sure you're ready to update all systems using that key before regenerating it.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="lock" title="Encryption key issues">
    ### Encryption Key Issues
    
    If you're having problems with encryption keys:
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Understand Key Types">
        Remember that EnSync uses two types of encryption keys:
        - Public Key: Used by others to send encrypted messages to your app
        - Decrypt Key (Private Key): Used by your app to decrypt incoming messages
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Verify Key Storage">
        Ensure you've stored your decrypt key securely. Like app keys, decrypt keys are only shown once when created or regenerated.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Check Key Format">
        Verify that you're using the keys in their correct format without any modifications or truncations.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Regenerate Keys if Needed">
        If you've lost your decrypt key or suspect it's compromised, you can regenerate both your app key and encryption keys from the app management interface.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  <Accordion icon="gear" title="App configuration problems">
    ### App Configuration Problems
    
    If you're experiencing issues with app configuration:
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Check App Details">
        Verify that the app name and other details are correctly configured in the management console.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Review App Status">
        Ensure the app hasn't been disabled or deleted. Check the app list to confirm it's still active.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Verify Event Permissions">
        Double-check that the app has the correct send and receive permissions configured for the events it needs to work with.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Check for Duplicate Apps">
        Sometimes issues occur because multiple apps with similar names or purposes exist. Verify you're managing the correct app.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="shield-exclamation" title="App access issues">
    ### App Access Issues
    
    If you're having problems accessing or managing apps:
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Check User Permissions">
        Verify that your user account has the necessary permissions to manage apps in the workspace.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Review Workspace Access">
        Ensure you're in the correct workspace where the app is located.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Clear Browser Cache">
        Sometimes browser caching can cause management console issues. Try clearing your browser cache or using a private/incognito window.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Contact Workspace Admin">
        If you still can't access or manage apps, contact your workspace administrator to verify your permissions.

## App Analytics Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="chart-line" title="Analytics data issues">
    ### Analytics Data Issues
    
    If you're experiencing problems with app analytics data:
    
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Check Data Timeframes">
        Verify you're looking at the correct time period. Use the date range selector to adjust the timeframe you're analyzing.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Verify App Selection">
        Make sure you've selected the correct app in the analytics dashboard. The "All Apps" view might be hiding app-specific patterns.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Check for Data Processing Delays">
        Analytics data can sometimes take a few minutes to process. If you're looking for very recent activity, try refreshing after a short wait.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Export Data if Needed">
        If you need to analyze the data more deeply, use the export options to download the data as CSV for further analysis.

  <Accordion icon="chart-mixed" title="Unexpected analytics patterns">

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Look for App Changes">
        Check if there have been recent changes to the app's permissions or configuration that might explain the pattern.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Compare with Other Apps">
        Use the comparison view to see if the pattern affects multiple apps or just one specific app.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Check for System Maintenance">
        Verify if there was any system maintenance or downtime that might have affected the data collection.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Review Event Volume">
        Look at the event volume metrics to see if there are unusual spikes or drops that might indicate issues.
      </Step>
      
      <Step title="Establish Regular Monitoring">
