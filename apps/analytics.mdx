## Analytics Dashboard

The Apps Analytics section provides valuable insights into how your apps are performing, what events they're publishing and receiving, and how they're being used by partners and other apps.

## Key Metrics

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Apps Published Events" icon="paper-plane">
    The total number of events published by the selected app (or all apps if "All Apps" is selected). This shows how active your app is in sending data to EnSync.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Apps Received Events" icon="inbox">
    The total number of events received by the selected app. This shows how much data your app is consuming from EnSync.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Active Subscribers" icon="users">
    The number of active connections currently subscribed to events from this app. This indicates how many partners or other apps are actively listening to events from this app.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## App Traffic Chart

The App Traffic Chart visualizes event activity over time, helping you identify patterns, trends, and potential issues.

### Chart Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="chart-line" title="Event Visualization">
    A line chart showing published vs. received events over time (default: last 5 days). The chart uses different colors to distinguish between published events (typically blue) and received events (typically green).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="calendar" title="Date Range Selection">
    You can customize the time period shown in the chart:
    - Set a custom date range using the Start and End date pickers
    - Clear the date range to return to the default view (last 5 days)
    - Use preset ranges like "Last 24 hours," "Last 7 days," or "Last 30 days"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="magnifying-glass" title="Zoom and Pan">
    Interact with the chart to focus on specific time periods:
    - Click and drag horizontally to zoom in on a specific time range
    - Use the zoom buttons to zoom in or out
    - Click and drag the chart to pan left or right
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="download" title="Export Options">
    Export chart data for further analysis:
    - Download as PNG image
    - Download as CSV data
    - Copy chart data to clipboard
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Using the Chart

The App Traffic Chart helps you:
- Identify spikes in activity that might indicate unusual behavior
- Spot when an app stops publishing or receiving, which could indicate a problem
- Compare send vs. receive patterns to understand data flow
- Correlate event activity with business events or system changes

## Events Table

Below the traffic chart, you'll find a detailed breakdown of event activity by event type.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/events-table.png" alt="Events Table" />
</Frame>

### Table Columns

The Events Table shows:
- **Event Name**: The specific event type (e.g., `order/created`, `payment/completed`)
- **Published**: How many times this app published this event
- **Received**: How many times this app received this event
- **Total**: Sum of published and received events

### Table Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="sort" title="Sorting">
    Click any column header to sort the table by that column:
    - Sort by event name (alphabetically)
    - Sort by number of published events (highest or lowest)
    - Sort by number of received events (highest or lowest)
    - Sort by total events (highest or lowest)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="filter" title="Filtering">
    Use the search box above the table to filter events by name. This is useful when you have many events and want to focus on specific ones.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="download" title="Export">
    Export the events table data as a CSV file for further analysis in spreadsheet software or other tools.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Using the Table

This table helps you understand:
- Which events are most active for this app
- Whether an app is primarily a publisher or consumer of events
- If there are events configured but not being used
- The overall distribution of event traffic

## App Comparison

You can compare activity across multiple apps to understand how they interact and identify patterns.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select 'All Apps' from the dropdown">
    This shows aggregate metrics across all your apps.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use the comparison view">
    Click the "Compare Apps" button to view multiple apps side by side.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Analyze the comparison chart">
    The chart will show multiple lines, one for each selected app, allowing you to compare activity patterns.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Monitoring Best Practices

<Note>
  Regular monitoring of your app analytics is essential for maintaining system health and identifying issues early.
</Note>

Consider these monitoring practices:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="chart-line" title="Activity Monitoring">
    Regularly check for:
    - Apps that have stopped publishing events
    - Apps that have stopped receiving events
    - Unexpected drops in event volume
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="triangle-exclamation" title="Error Monitoring">
    Periodically review logs for:
    - Authentication errors
    - Permission denied errors
    - Connection failures
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="gauge-high" title="Volume Monitoring">
    Keep an eye on:
    - Unusual spikes in event volume
    - Event volume approaching your plan limits
    - Significant changes in subscriber count
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
