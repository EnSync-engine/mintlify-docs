## What are Apps?

Apps represent your internal systems, services, or applications that connect to EnSync to publish or receive events. Each app is an authenticated entity with specific permissions controlling what events it can send and receive.

Think of apps as your own services that need to communicate through EnSync:
- Your order management system
- Your payment processing service
- Your inventory tracking system
- Your notification service
- Your analytics platform

## Apps vs. Integration Pages

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Apps" icon="window-restore">
    - Systems you control
    - You create and manage their credentials
    - You define their permissions explicitly
    - Used for your internal services
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Integration Pages" icon="handshake">
    - Portals for external partners
    - Partners generate their own credentials
    - Partners choose which events to subscribe to (from what you expose)
    - Used for external integrations
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

An app can be used to power an integration page, but they serve different purposes.
