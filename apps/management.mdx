## Creating an App

Creating a new app in EnSync is straightforward and only takes a few steps.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Apps Section">
    From the EnSync dashboard, click on "Apps" in the main navigation menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Create New App">
    Click the "Create New App" button in the top-right corner of the Apps page.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter App Details">
    In the modal that appears, enter the app details:
    
    **App Name Field:**
    Enter a descriptive name for your app. This is required and helps you identify the app in your dashboard.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/app-creation-form.png" alt="App Creation Form" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Permissions">
    **Send Events Section:**
    A multi-select dropdown showing all available events in your workspace. Select which events this app should be allowed to publish. You can search for events by typing in the search box.
    
    **Receive Events Section:**
    Another multi-select dropdown for choosing which events this app should be allowed to receive. These are the events your app will be notified about.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create the App">
    Click the "Create App" button at the bottom of the modal to create your app.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save Your Credentials">
    A success modal displays showing:
    - App Name (confirmation of what you created)
    - App Key (authentication credential - copy this immediately)
    - Public Key (for encryption - copy this)
    - Decrypt Key (private key for decryption - copy this immediately)
    
    Each field has a copy button. **Copy all three keys and store them securely.** You won't be able to view them again after closing this modal.
    
    <Warning>
      These credentials are shown only once. If you don't save them now, you'll need to regenerate them later, which will invalidate the original credentials.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Editing Apps

You can modify an app's name and permissions after creation. However, you cannot view or directly edit the app's credentials.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the App">
    From the Apps page, find the app you want to edit in the list.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open Edit Mode">
    Click the three-dot menu next to the app and select "Edit".
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Modify App Details">
    In the edit modal, you can change:
    
    **App Name:**
    Change the display name of the app. This doesn't affect authentication or permissions.
    
    **Send Permissions:**
    Add or remove events the app can publish. Changes take effect immediately:
    - Adding an event: App can now publish it
    - Removing an event: App can no longer publish it (attempts will fail)
    
    **Receive Permissions:**
    Add or remove events the app can receive. Changes take effect immediately:
    - Adding an event: App will start receiving it
    - Removing an event: App will stop receiving it
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click "Save Changes" to apply your modifications.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  You cannot view or change the app key, public key, or decrypt key when editing. These can only be regenerated (which creates new keys).
</Note>

## Regenerating App Keys

If your app key is compromised or lost, you can regenerate it. This creates a new set of credentials and invalidates the old ones.

<Warning>
  Regenerating keys will immediately invalidate the old credentials. Any systems using the old credentials will stop working until updated with the new ones.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the App">
    From the Apps page, find the app that needs new credentials.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Regenerate Key">
    Click the three-dot menu next to the app and select "Regenerate Key".
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm Regeneration">
    A confirmation modal appears warning that the old key will stop working. Click "Regenerate" to confirm.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save New Credentials">
    A new modal displays the new keys:
    - App Key
    - Public Key
    - Decrypt Key
    
    Copy these keys immediatelyâ€”they won't be shown again.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update Your Systems">
    Update all systems that use these credentials as soon as possible to restore functionality.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deleting Apps

When you no longer need an app, you can delete it. This is a permanent action that cannot be undone.

<Warning>
  Deleting an app permanently removes it from your workspace and invalidates all its credentials. Any systems using these credentials will immediately lose access.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the App">
    From the Apps page, find the app you want to delete.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Delete">
    Click the three-dot menu next to the app and select "Delete".
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm Deletion">
    A confirmation modal appears asking you to confirm the deletion. Type the app name to confirm and click "Delete".
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Before Deleting an App

Before you delete an app, consider:

<Check>
  Ensure no systems are actively using this app's credentials
</Check>

<Check>
  Check the analytics to see if the app is still active
</Check>

<Check>
  Consider disabling the app first (by removing all permissions) to test impact
</Check>

## App Status Indicators

Apps don't have explicit online/offline status, but you can infer their state from:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Active Subscribers" icon="users">
    If this number is greater than 0, the app has active connections listening for events.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Recent Activity" icon="chart-line">
    Check the traffic chart and events table:
    - Recent published events: App is actively sending data
    - Recent received events: App is actively consuming data
    - No recent activity: App may be offline or idle
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Last Active Timestamp" icon="clock">
    Shown in the apps list, this indicates when the app last interacted with EnSync.
  </Card>
