## What Are Events?

Events are messages published and delivered through EnSync at runtime. They represent actions or state changes in your system (e.g., `order/created`, `payment/completed`, `inventory/updated`).

**Event Definitions** are optional schemas that define the expected structure of events. **Events** are the actual messages published with real data. If an event definition exists, EnSync validates the payload before publishing.

## Event Structure

Every event in EnSync contains:

- **eventName**: The event path (e.g., `order/created`)
- **payload**: Your custom data
- **idem**: Unique event ID for idempotency
- **block**: Block ID for ordering
- **timestamp**: When the event was created
- **sender**: The appId of the publisher
- **metadata**: System-generated metadata including `$internal` fields

## Event Flow

1. **Publish**: Service provider publishes an event to specific recipients
2. **Queue**: EnSync queues the event per recipient's appId and eventId
3. **Deliver**: EnSync pushes events one at a time to subscribers
4. **Process**: Subscriber processes and acknowledges/defers/discards

## Key Features

- **Ordered delivery**: Events are delivered in order per event type
- **At-least-once delivery**: Events are guaranteed to be delivered
- **90-day retention**: Events are stored for replay and debugging
- **End-to-end encryption**: All events are encrypted in transit and at rest
