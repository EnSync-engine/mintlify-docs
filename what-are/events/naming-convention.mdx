## Event Naming Format

Event names use a path-like structure with forward slashes:

```
resource/action
```

### Examples

- `order/created`
- `payment/completed`
- `inventory/updated`
- `user/deleted`

## Naming Guidelines

### Use Lowercase

```
✅ order/created
❌ Order/Created
❌ ORDER/CREATED
```

### Use Past Tense

Events represent things that have already happened:

```
✅ order/created
✅ payment/completed
❌ order/create
❌ payment/complete
```

### Be Specific

```
✅ order/shipped
✅ order/delivered
❌ order/status-changed
```

### Use Hierarchies

Organize related events under common prefixes:

```
order/created
order/updated
order/cancelled
order/shipped
order/delivered
```

## Wildcards in Subscriptions

Subscribers can use wildcards to match multiple events:

```javascript
// Subscribe to all order events
await client.subscribe("order/*");

// Subscribe to all events
await client.subscribe("*");
```

## Versioning

See the [Tips](/what-are/events/tips) page for event versioning strategies.
