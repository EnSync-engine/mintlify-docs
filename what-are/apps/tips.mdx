## Deleting Apps

To delete an app, remove it via the EnSync Dashboard or Config Manager API.

<Warning>
**Before deleting, ensure no apps are running with that appKey!**

Deleting an app is **permanent** and will:
- Invalidate the appKey (clients can't connect)
- Delete all queued events for that app
- Remove the app from EnSync Dashboard
- Break any publishers sending events to this appId
</Warning>

### Before Deleting

1. **Stop all running instances**: Ensure no workers are using this appKey
2. **Notify publishers**: Tell partners to stop sending events to this appId
3. **Process remaining events**: Ensure all queued events are processed
4. **Update integrations**: Remove references to this app from your code
5. **Backup credentials**: Save appKey/appSecret if you need to reference them later

### Deletion Process

You can delete apps in the EnSync Dashboard or via the API. See [API Reference](/api-reference/endpoint/access-keys/list) for programmatic deletion.

## Changing appSecret

You cannot directly change an appSecret. Instead, you need to create a new SERVICE access key and migrate.

### Migration Process

1. **Create new app**: Generate new SERVICE access key (see [Create Access Key](/api-reference/endpoint/access-keys/create))

2. **Update your service**: Deploy with new appKey and appSecret

```javascript
const client = await EnSyncClient.create({
  appKey: "new-app-key",
  appSecret: "new-app-secret"
});
```

3. **Notify publishers**: Share your new appId

4. **Monitor old app**: Watch for remaining events in old queue

5. **Deprecate old app**: After transition period, delete old app

### Zero-Downtime Migration

Run both apps simultaneously during migration:

```javascript
// Old app - processes remaining events
const oldClient = await EnSyncClient.create({
  appKey: "old-app-key",
  appSecret: "old-app-secret"
});

// New app - receives new events
const newClient = await EnSyncClient.create({
  appKey: "new-app-key",
  appSecret: "new-app-secret"
});

// Both subscribe to same events
await oldClient.subscribe("payment/*");
await newClient.subscribe("payment/*");
```

## App Organization

### Environment Separation

Create separate apps per environment:

```
my-service-production
my-service-staging
my-service-development
```

Benefits:
- Isolated event queues
- Different permissions per environment
- Easier debugging and testing
- Prevents production incidents from dev/staging

### Service Separation

Create separate apps per microservice:

```
order-service
payment-service
inventory-service
notification-service
```

Benefits:
- Clear ownership and responsibilities
- Granular permissions
- Independent scaling
- Better monitoring and logs

### Permission Scoping

Grant minimal permissions to each app:

```javascript
// Order service - only needs to publish orders
{
  "send": ["order/*"],
  "receive": []
}

// Payment service - only needs to receive orders and publish payments
{
  "send": ["payment/*"],
  "receive": ["order/*"]
}
```

## Monitoring Apps

### Check Connection Status

```javascript
client.on('connected', () => {
  console.log('Connected to EnSync');
});

client.on('disconnected', () => {
  console.log('Disconnected from EnSync');
});

client.on('error', (error) => {
  console.error('EnSync error:', error);
});
```

### Track Event Metrics

Monitor in EnSync Dashboard:
- **Events published**: How many events your app sends
- **Events received**: How many events your app gets
- **Queue depth**: How many events are waiting
- **Processing time**: How long events take to process
- **Error rate**: How many events fail

### Use Logs Dashboard

The Logs dashboard shows:
- Connection events
- Publish/subscribe activity
- Errors and failures
- Permission denials

## Getting Help

For app management issues:

1. Check the **Logs** dashboard for error messages
2. Verify permissions in EnSync Dashboard
3. Contact support at **support@ensync.cloud** with:
   - App name
   - Description of the issue
   - Error messages from logs
   - Timestamp of the issue
