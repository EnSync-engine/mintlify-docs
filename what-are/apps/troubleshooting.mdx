## Connection Issues

### Can't Connect to EnSync

**Symptoms**: Client fails to connect, timeout errors

**Solutions**:

1. **Verify credentials**: Check appKey and appSecret are correct
2. **Check network connectivity**: Ensure you can reach EnSync broker
3. **Verify firewall rules**: Allow outbound connections
4. **Check app status**: Verify app hasn't been deleted

### Frequent Disconnections

**Symptoms**: Client connects but disconnects repeatedly

**Solutions**:

1. **Check network stability**: Unstable networks cause reconnections
2. **Monitor connection events**: Log disconnect reasons
3. **Implement reconnection logic**: SDK handles this automatically

## Permission Errors

### Can't Publish Events

**Error**: `Permission denied: send not allowed for event path`

**Solutions**:

1. **Check send permissions**: View in EnSync Dashboard or via [Get Permissions API](/api-reference/endpoint/access-keys/get-permissions)

2. **Update permissions**: Update in EnSync Dashboard or via [Update Permissions API](/api-reference/endpoint/access-keys/update-permissions)

### Can't Subscribe to Events

**Error**: `Permission denied: receive not allowed for event path`

**Solutions**:

1. **Check receive permissions**: Verify your app has `receive` permission for the event path
2. **Update permissions**: Add the event path to `receive` array

## Using Logs Dashboard

The **Logs** dashboard in EnSync Dashboard shows:

- **Connection events**: When your app connects/disconnects
- **Publish activity**: Events your app publishes
- **Subscribe activity**: Events your app receives
- **Errors**: Failed operations with details
- **Permission denials**: Unauthorized access attempts

### Accessing Logs

1. Log in to EnSync Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Logs** section
3. Filter by:
   - AppKey
   - Event name
   - Time range
   - Error type

## Using Monitoring Dashboard

The **Monitoring** dashboard provides metrics:

- **Event throughput**: Events per second
- **Queue depth**: Pending events
- **Processing time**: Average time to process
- **Error rate**: Failed events percentage
- **Connection status**: Active/inactive workers

### Setting Up Alerts

Configure alerts for:
- High queue depth (events backing up)
- High error rate (processing failures)
- Connection failures (app offline)

## Getting Help

If issues persist:

1. **Check Logs dashboard**: Review error messages and timestamps
2. **Check Monitoring dashboard**: Look for unusual metrics
3. **Contact support**: Email **support@ensync.cloud** with:
   - App name
