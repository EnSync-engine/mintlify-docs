## What is appKey?

The **appKey** is a secret credential used to authenticate your SDK client connections to the EnSync broker. It's returned as `accessKey` when you create a SERVICE type access key.

## Usage

Pass the appKey when creating your EnSync client:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
    ```javascript
    const client = await EnSyncClient.create({
      appKey: "ensk_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      appSecret: "your-app-secret"
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    client = await EnSyncClient.create(
        app_key="ensk_prod_xxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        app_secret="your-app-secret"
    )
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Security

<Warning>
**Keep your appKey secret!** Anyone with your appKey can:
- Publish events as your app
- Subscribe to events sent to your app
- Consume events from your queue
</Warning>

### Best Practices

- **Never commit to version control**: Use environment variables
- **Rotate regularly**: Create new keys and deprecate old ones
- **Use different keys per environment**: Separate dev/staging/production
- **Limit permissions**: Only grant necessary send/receive permissions

```bash
# ✅ Use environment variables
export ENSYNC_APP_KEY="ensk_prod_xxxxx"
export ENSYNC_APP_SECRET="xxxxx"

# ❌ Don't hardcode
const appKey = "ensk_prod_xxxxx"; // Bad!
```

## Sharing appKey

Multiple workers can share the same appKey to scale horizontally:

```javascript
// Worker 1
const client1 = await EnSyncClient.create({ appKey, appSecret });

// Worker 2 (same appKey)
const client2 = await EnSyncClient.create({ appKey, appSecret });
```

EnSync coordinates which worker receives which event, preventing duplicates.

## Permissions

Each appKey has associated permissions that control:
- Which events it can publish (`send`)
- Which events it can subscribe to (`receive`)

You can view and update permissions in the EnSync Dashboard or via the API. See:
- [Get Access Key Permissions](/api-reference/endpoint/access-keys/get-permissions)
- [Update Access Key Permissions](/api-reference/endpoint/access-keys/update-permissions)
