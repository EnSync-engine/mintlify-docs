## What are Integrations?

Integrations (also called Integration Pages) are self-service portals where external partners can connect to your EnSync platform. Each integration page is a unique URL you share with partners, allowing them to browse your event catalog, generate their own credentials, and subscribe to eventsâ€”all without requiring engineering work from your team.

Think of an integration page as a storefront for your events. Partners visit the page, see what's available, and connect themselves.

## Integration Components

### Integration Name

A descriptive identifier for the integration page. This helps you organize multiple integration pages for different partner types or use cases.

Examples:
- "Payment Partners Integration"
- "Shipping Providers Portal"
- "Analytics Partners Access"
- "Public API Integration"

### Integration URL

A unique, shareable URL that partners use to access the integration page. The URL typically follows the format:
```
https://ensync.cloud/integrate/{integration-id}
```

Partners who visit this URL can:
- Browse available events
- Read event descriptions and schemas
- Generate their own app credentials
- Subscribe to events they need

### Exposed Events (Send Permissions)

The list of events you've chosen to make available on this integration page. These are events that partners can subscribe to and receive from you.

When you expose events, partners see:
- Event names
- Event descriptions
- Event schemas (data structure)
- Example payloads

You control exactly which events appear on each integration page, allowing you to create different pages for different partner types.

### Callback Events (Receive Permissions)

Events that partners connecting through this integration page can publish back to you. This enables bi-directional communication.

For example, if you expose `order/created` to shipping partners, you might allow them to publish `shipment/updated` back to you.

## Events and Integration Pages

When you create an integration page for partners, you select which events to include in the catalog. Partners browsing your integration page will see:

- All events you've chosen to expose
- Their descriptions and schemas
- The ability to subscribe to events they need

You can create multiple integration pages with different event sets for different partner types. For example:
- Payment partners see payment-related events
- Shipping partners see order and shipment events
- Analytics partners see all events

## Managing Integrations

Create and manage integration pages in the EnSync Dashboard. The dashboard provides an intuitive interface for:
- Creating integration pages
- Selecting which events to expose
- Customizing branding and appearance
- Monitoring partner connections
- Viewing integration analytics

For programmatic management, see the [Config Manager API](/api-reference/introduction).
