## What are Events?

Events are the core building blocks of EnSync. They represent messages that flow between your systems and your partners. Each event carries specific information about something that happened in your business.

Think of events as announcements:
- When an order is placed, you publish an `order/created` event
- When payment is confirmed, you publish a `payment/completed` event
- When a partner ships an item, they publish a `shipment/updated` event back to you

Events flow in both directionsâ€”you send events to partners, and partners send events back to you.

## Event Structure

Every event in EnSync has three main components:

### Event Name

The event name identifies what type of message this is. Names use a path-like structure to organize related events:

- `order/created`
- `order/updated`
- `order/shipped`
- `payment/completed`
- `user/registered`

This structure helps partners quickly understand your event catalog and find the events they need.

### Event Description

A human-readable explanation of what this event represents and when it's triggered. This helps partners understand:
- What business action triggered this event
- What information they can expect to receive
- How they might use this event in their systems

The description is optional but highly recommended for clarity.

### Event Schema

The schema defines the structure of data this event carries. It's a map of field names to data types.

**Schema is optional.** If you don't define a schema, the event can carry any data structure. However, defining a schema helps partners understand what to expect and makes integration easier.
