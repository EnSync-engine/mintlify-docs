## Creating Events

Creating new events in EnSync is straightforward and only takes a few steps.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Events Section">
    From the EnSync dashboard, click on "Events" in the main navigation menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Create New Event">
    Click the "Create New Event" button in the top-right corner of the Events page.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Event Details">
    In the modal that appears, enter the event details:
    
    **Event Name:**
    Enter a name following the recommended format (e.g., `order/created`). This is required and will be used by apps and integrations to publish and subscribe to this event.
    
    **Description:**
    Provide a clear explanation of what this event represents, when it's triggered, and what information it contains. This helps partners understand how to use the event.
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/event-creation-form.png" alt="Event Creation Form" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Define Schema (Optional)">
    If you want to define a schema for this event:
    
    1. Click "Add Schema"
    2. For each field in your event payload:
       - Enter the field name (e.g., `order_id`)
       - Select the data type (string, integer, boolean, etc.)
       - Add a description (optional)
    3. For nested objects, click "Add Object" and define its fields
    4. For arrays, click "Add Array" and define its item structure
    
    The schema helps partners understand what data to expect in the event payload.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create the Event">
    Click the "Create Event" button at the bottom of the modal to create your event.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="View Event Details">
    After creation, you'll see a success message and the event will appear in your events list. Click on it to view details, including code snippets for publishing and subscribing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Viewing Event Details

Click on any event in your event list to open its details modal. This modal shows:

**Event Information:**
- Full event name
- Description (if provided)
- Schema definition (if provided)
- When the event was created

**Code Snippets:**
- Examples in multiple programming languages showing how to publish this event
- Sample payload based on your schema
- Authentication setup instructions

**Actions:**
- Edit the event description or schema
- Delete the event (with warnings about dependent integrations)
- Copy the event name for use in your code

## Editing Events

When you click "Edit" on an event, you can modify:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="pen" title="Description">
    Update the explanation of what this event represents. Changes are visible immediately to anyone viewing your event catalog.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="table-list" title="Schema">
    You can add, remove, or modify fields in the schema. The schema editor shows a visual interface where you can:
    - Add new fields with their data types
    - Change existing field types
    - Remove fields you no longer need
    - Nest objects for complex data structures
    
    **Important:** Changing a schema doesn't affect messages already sent. It only impacts how partners understand future messages and what they should expect.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  You cannot change an event's name after creation. If you need a different name, create a new event and consider deprecating the old one.
</Warning>

## Deleting Events

When you delete an event, a confirmation modal appears with important warnings:

**What happens when you delete:**
- The event is removed from your event catalog
- Partners can no longer subscribe to this event
- Apps can no longer publish this event
- Existing integrations using this event will stop working

**Before deleting:**
- Check which partners are subscribed to this event
- Notify partners that this event will be discontinued
- Update any apps that publish this event
- Consider deprecating the event first (update description to mark as deprecated) before fully removing it

## Event Versioning

If you need to make breaking changes to an event (like changing field types or removing fields), consider creating a new version instead of modifying the existing one:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Event">
    Create a new event with a versioned name (e.g., `order/created/v2`)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Document the Differences">
    In the description, clearly explain how this version differs from the previous one
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update Your Apps">
    Configure your apps to publish to both versions during a transition period
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Notify Partners">
    Let partners know about the new version and provide migration guidance
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Adoption">
    Track which partners have migrated to the new version
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Eventually Deprecate">
    Once all partners have migrated, you can deprecate the old version
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Schema Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="minimize" title="Start simple">
    Begin with basic fields and add complexity only when needed. A simple schema is easier for partners to implement.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="repeat" title="Use consistent field names">
    If you use `customer_email` in one event, use it in all events. Don't switch between `customer_email`, `user_email`, and `email`.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="ruler" title="Document units and formats">
    In the description, clarify:
    - Currency amounts (are they in cents or dollars?)
    - Date formats (ISO 8601 timestamps?)
    - ID formats (integers or UUIDs?)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="circle-check" title="Consider optional vs required">
    While EnSync doesn't enforce required fields, document in your description which fields will always be present and which might be absent.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Monitoring Event Usage

From the Events page, you can see:
- How many partners are subscribed to each event
- How many messages have been published for each event
- Which apps are publishing each event

This helps you:
- Identify your most popular events
- Find unused events that might be candidates for removal
- Understand which events drive the most integration value
