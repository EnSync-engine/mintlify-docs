## Event Types Overview

Events in EnSync follow a structured naming convention that helps organize and categorize different types of messages flowing through the system. A well-designed event naming system makes your integration ecosystem more intuitive and easier to manage.

## Event Naming Structure

Event names use a path-like structure to organize related events:

- `order/created`
- `order/updated`
- `order/shipped`
- `payment/completed`
- `user/registered`

This hierarchical structure helps quickly understand your event catalog and find specific events.

## Event Naming Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="pen" title="Use clear, descriptive names">
    **Good examples:**
    - `order/shipped`
    - `payment/failed`
    - `user/updated`
    
    **Avoid:**
    - `event1`
    - `data`
    - `msg`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="folder-tree" title="Group related events with prefixes">
    **Order events:**
    - `order/created`
    - `order/updated`
    - `order/cancelled`
    
    **Payment events:**
    - `payment/initiated`
    - `payment/completed`
    - `payment/refunded`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="clock" title="Use consistent verb tenses">
    **Past tense for completed actions:**
    - `order/created`
    - `payment/completed`
    
    **Present tense for ongoing states:**
    - `inventory/low`
    - `system/healthy`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="text-width" title="Keep names concise">
    Partners will type these names in their code. Shorter names are easier to remember and less error-prone.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Event Versioning

If you need to make breaking changes to an event (like changing field types or removing fields), consider creating a new version:

- Current: `order/created`
- New version: `order/created/v2`

This allows:
- Existing partners to continue using the old version
- New partners to adopt the improved version
- Gradual migration without breaking existing integrations

Document the differences between versions in each event's description.
