description: 'Automate EnSync configuration with the Config Manager API'
---

The Config Manager API enables service providers and self-hosted EnSync users to programmatically manage their EnSync configuration.

## Use Cases

- **Automation**: Script workspace, event, and access key creation
- **CI/CD Integration**: Configure EnSync as part of deployment pipelines
- **Self-Hosted Management**: Manage your own EnSync instance programmatically
- **Multi-Environment Setup**: Replicate configurations across dev/staging/production

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an **ACCOUNT** type access key in the `X-API-KEY` header. ACCOUNT keys are used for administrative purposes to manage your EnSync configuration.

```bash
curl -X GET https://config.gms.ensync.cloud/v1/workspace \
  -H "X-API-KEY: your-account-access-key"
```

## Base URL

```
https://config.gms.ensync.cloud/v1
```

## API Resources

- **Access Keys**: Manage authentication keys and permissions
  - **SERVICE** keys: Connect to the EnSync broker (apps in EnSync Dashboard)
  - **ACCOUNT** keys: Administrative access to this Config Manager API
- **Event Definitions**: Define and update event schemas
