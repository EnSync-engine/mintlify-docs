## Overview

Access Keys are a fundamental security and integration feature of the EnSync platform. They serve as secure credentials that control how applications, services, and users interact with the EnSync ecosystem.

## Types of Access Keys

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Account Keys" icon="user-gear">
    Designed for administrative and management purposes:
    
    - Administrative Control: Manage resources, configurations, and settings
    - Resource Management: Create, read, update, and delete EnSync resources
    - Permission-based: Can be configured with specific permissions for different resources
    - UI Integration: Used by dashboard applications and administrative tools
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Service Keys" icon="server">
    Enable secure service-to-service communication:
    
    - Event Streaming: Allow services to send and receive events
    - Automated Processes: Used by background processes and automated workflows
    - Specialized Access: Typically limited to specific event types or operations
    - System Integration: Connect external systems to the EnSync ecosystem

## Real-World Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="users-gear" title="Multi-Team Development">
    When multiple teams are developing against EnSync, each team can have their own access keys with appropriate permissions, preventing accidental interference between teams.
    
    <div className="mt-4 p-3 bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded">
      <strong>Example:</strong> Team A works on payment processing while Team B works on inventory management. Each team has access keys that limit their access to only the events and resources relevant to their domain.
    </div>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="cubes" title="Microservice Architecture">
    In a microservice architecture, each service can have its own access key with precisely the permissions it needs, enhancing security and reducing potential blast radius of compromised credentials.
    
    <div className="mt-4 p-3 bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded">
      <strong>Example:</strong> A payment processing microservice has an access key that only allows it to publish payment events and subscribe to account verification events.
    </div>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="handshake" title="Third-Party Integration">
    When integrating with third-party services, provide them with limited-scope access keys that only grant access to the specific resources they need.
    
    <div className="mt-4 p-3 bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded">
      <strong>Example:</strong> A shipping provider integration receives an access key that only allows it to subscribe to order fulfillment events.
    </div>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="gears" title="CI/CD Pipelines">
    Automated deployment pipelines can use service keys to securely deploy and configure EnSync resources without requiring human intervention.
    
    <div className="mt-4 p-3 bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded">
      <strong>Example:</strong> A CI/CD pipeline uses a service key to automatically update event definitions when new code is deployed.
    </div>
  </Accordion>

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Follow Least Privilege">
    Only grant the permissions that are absolutely necessary for each key's intended purpose.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Regular Rotation">
    Implement a key rotation schedule for sensitive environments to limit the impact of potentially compromised keys.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Environment Separation">
    Use different keys for development, testing, and production environments to prevent accidental cross-environment actions.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitoring">
    Set up alerts for unusual access key usage patterns to quickly detect potential security incidents.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Documentation">
    Maintain clear documentation of what each key is used for, who owns it, and when it was last rotated.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Access Keys are a cornerstone of EnSync's security model, providing both protection and flexibility while enabling seamless integration across your technology ecosystem.
