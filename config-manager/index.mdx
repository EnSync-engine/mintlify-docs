## Feature Details

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Access Key Management">
    The Config Manager allows you to create and manage access keys that control which applications and services can interact with EnSync resources. These keys come in two types:

    - **Account Keys**: Used by administrative applications to manage EnSync resources
    - **Service Keys**: Used by services to send and receive events within the EnSync ecosystem

    For detailed information on creating and managing access keys, see the [Access Keys Documentation](/config-manager/access-keys).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="lock" title="Permission Control">
    Fine-grained permissions let you control exactly what each application or service can do:

    - Control access to specific resources like events, logs, and integrations
    - Set read, write, and update permissions for different resources
    - Define hierarchical permission paths for precise access control
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="folder-tree" title="Workspace Management">
    Workspaces provide logical separation between different environments or projects:

    - Create and manage workspaces to organize your resources
    - Control access to resources within specific workspaces
    - Maintain separation between development, testing, and production environments
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="code-branch" title="Event Definition Management">
    Config Manager allows you to define and manage event structures:

    - Create standardized event definitions that services can use
    - Ensure consistency in event data across your ecosystem
    - Update event definitions as your needs evolve

    Learn more about working with event definitions in the [Event Definitions Guide](/config-manager/event-definitions).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="cloud" title="API Access">
    All functionality is accessible through a comprehensive REST API:

    - RESTful API for standard HTTP-based integration
    - Complete [OpenAPI specification](/config-manager/openapi-reference) documentation
    - Authentication using secure access keys

    For information on automating tasks using the API, see the [API Automation Guide](/config-manager/api-automation).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="shield-halved" title="Security Features">
    Built with security in mind:

    - Cryptographic verification of access keys
    - Service key pair management for secure communication
    - Permission validation to prevent unauthorized access
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
